# Urbanpopulation_trends
The objective of the project is to create an interactive map to visualize the dataset using Mapbox GL JS.The dataset consists of the identified World urban areas past,present and projected population trends for the term of 1950-2050.
<h2>About the Map</h2>
<p>The Map is created from a database which represents the historic, current and future estimates and projections with number of inhabitants for the world's largest urban areas from 1950-2050. The data covers cities and other urban areas with more than 750,000 people.
  To give more details on the data source click on this <a href="https://nordpil.com/resources/world-database-of-large-cities/">link</a>.
  The data is available in Shapefile format but is chnaged to JSON format to simplify querying features. The source data is added to the map as <a href=https://www.mapbox.com/studio-manual/reference/tilesets/>Mapbox Tileset</a>. While switching between the buttons we can visualize the data as points and also as a heatmap. Heat map visualizes the data based on population densities. 
<h2>Further Work</h2>
<p>Create an interactive environment within the map to query the map features to change the visualisation of data by taking the year and urban area. Some helpful examples include https://www.mapbox.com/help/show-changes-over-time/
